        <h3> All of us</h3>
            <p>
                Diversity is one of the core values of the All of Us Research Program. All of Us is asking lots of people to join the
                program. Participants are from different races, ethnicities, age groups, and regions of the country. They are also
                diverse in gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, education, disability, and health status.

            <h3>Identity</h3>
            <p>
            Identity is the qualities, beliefs, personality, looks and/or expressions that make a person (self-identity as
            emphasized in psychology[1]) or group (collective identity as pre-eminent in sociology).[citation needed] One can
            regard the awareness and the categorizing of identity as positive or as destructive.
            A psychological identity relates to self-image (one's mental model of oneself), self-esteem, and individuality.

            <h3>Stories</h3>
            <p>
                This week, we’re presenting stories about identity, whether its an external sense of cultural identity or an internal
                sense of self.
                Part 1: Mathematician and comic book writer Jason Rodriguez feels torn between separate cultural and professional
                identities.
                Jason Rodriguez is a writer, editor, educator, and applied mathematician.

            <h3>Colors</h3>
            <p>
            The fascination with the concept of color draws its origins from the Classical Greece time period, when scientist and
            philosopher Aristotle developed the first known color theory scheme. He was also among the first to compare colors to
            music, in order to produce definitions for conceptual logic and believed that they were sent from the heavens as rays:
            “in a sense, light makes potential colors into actual colors”.

    <h2>Why is diversity important to the All of Us Research Program?</h2>
    <p>
    Diversity in a research program is important for several reasons. First, where we live, how we live, and our background
    can all affect our health. Second, many groups of people have been left out of research in the past. This means
    researchers know less about their health.
